<p>
  Add-ons for Hass.io allow the user to extend the functionality around Home
    Assistant by installing additional applications.
</p>
<p>
  This can be running an application that Home Assistant can integrate with
    (like an MQTT broker) or to share the configuration via Samba for easy editing
    from other computers. Add-ons can be configured via the Hass.io panel in Home
    Assistant.

  Add-ons for Hass.io are freely available in the add-on store.
</p>

<p>
  To install add-ons, navigate to the Hass.io panel in your Home Assistant
    frontend, and click on the "ADD-ON STORE" tab. All add-ons, including their documentation, are available right from the store.
    Click on a add-on you are interested in, to read the documentation or to install the add-on.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Add-ons are only available if you've used the Hass.io installer. If you
    installed Home Assistant using any other method then you cannot use add-ons
    (but you can achieve the same result manually).
